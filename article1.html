        <p>This site is teeming with security vulnerabilities. Your task is to find and exploit them. This way, you'll playfully learn about simple hacking attacks. You'll see that the art of hacking is much easier than you expect.</p>
        <p class="blurred">The challenge consists of 5 parts in total. The tasks become progressively more difficult. If you manage to solve all tasks 100% on your own, you already have a deep understanding of web development. Congratulations!</p>
        <p class="blurred">In most cases, however, you won't be able to solve the tasks on your own. This is completely normal. For this reason, you will of course also receive a solution for this task. This will help you to understand everything again down to the last detail.</p>
        <p class="blurred">You can find the solution on YouTube. A video will explain the exact procedure. Ultimately, the pages are always analyzed in the same way. You'll be shown exactly how to proceed and how to find all 5 security vulnerabilities. The entire project is, of course, for educational purposes. The goal is to understand these mistakes. This will help you to avoid them in your daily work as a programmer.</p>
